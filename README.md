# Project Name: cs2263_hw1
## Description: 
Homework project 1 for CS2263: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
## Installation: 
To install and run the program simply copy the repo to your system using `git clone https://github.com/pratshow/cs2263_hw01.git`
Then use `gradle build` and finally `gradle run --args[args]` to run the program.
Or simply use `gradle run` to enter live mode where it will simulate a terminal where you can enter commands. Use `-h` or `--help` to get a list of commands
I **highly recommend** using `gradle --console plain run` if you use live mode since the gradle UI gets in the way during live mod.
## Usage: 
This program takes command line arguments to compute simple mathematical expressions and outputs them to the terminal or file. 
The program can also read expressions from a file.
When using `-b [file]` or `--batch [file]` the file needs to be in `/app/src/main/java/edu/isu/cs2263/hw01` directory or it can not be found.
